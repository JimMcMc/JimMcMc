- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @JimMcMc, aka Jim McElwaine. In NYC, I have been a professional performer, conductor. composer snd producer for over 45 years. That's not a mistype - since 1976. I am also a professor _emeritus_ of music at Purchase College Conservatory of Music. I started five production and composition curricula, both graduate and undergraduate, there with the help of some gifted musical savants. I hope to find more of those here.
- ðŸ‘€ To cop a phrase, Iâ€™m interested in how music works. All aspects, and I mean ALL.
